Chapter 2\nChapter 3\n\u2192\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE REVOLT OF THE OLD MEN\n\nT\nWO women were in it, and as they drove it ashore beaching it with the outrigger a-tilt, Dick, followed by Katafa, approached, and resting his hand on the mast stays attached to the outrigger gratings, he turned to the women, who, springing out, stood, paddles in hand, looking from him to Katafa.\n\n\u201cAnd the builders?\u201d asked he, \u201cwhere are they?\u201d\n\nThe shorter woman clucked her tongue and turned her face away towards the lagoon, the taller one looked Dick straight in the face.\n\n\u201cThey will not come,\u201d said she. \u201cThey say Uta Matu alone was their king and he is dead, also they say they are too old. \u2018A mataya ayana\u2019\u2014they are feeble and near past the fishing, even in the quiet water.\u201d\n\nThe shorter woman choked as if over a laugh, then she turned straight to Dick.\n\n\u201cThey will not come, Taori, all else is talk.\u201d\n\nShe was right. The express order had gone to them to cross over and they refused; they would not acknowledge the newcomer as their chief, all else was talk.\n\nSeveral villagers, seeing the canoe beaching, had run up and were listening, more were coming along. Already the subject was under whispered discussion amongst the group by the canoe, whilst Dick, his foot resting on the slightly tilted outrigger, stood, his eyes fixed on the sennit binding of the outrigger pole as if studying it profoundly.\n\nThe blaze of anger that had come into his eyes on hearing the news had passed; anger had given place to thought.\n\nThis was no ordinary business. Dick had never heard the word \u201crevolt,\u201d nor the word \u201cauthority,\u201d but he could think quite well without them. The only men who could direct the building of the big war canoes refused to work, and from the tone and looks of the women who brought the message, he saw quite clearly that if something were not done to bring the canoe-builders to heel, his power to make the natives do things would be gone.\n\nDick never wasted much time in thought. He turned from the canoe, raced up to the house where the little ships were carefully stored and came racing back with a fish spear.\n\nThen, calling to the women, he helped to run the canoe out, sprang on board and helped to raise the mat sail to the wind coming in from the break.\n\n\u201cI will soon return,\u201d he cried to Katafa, his voice borne across the sparkling water on a slant of the wind; then the women crouched down to ballast the canoe, and with the steering paddle in his hand he steered.\n\nThe canoe that had brought Katafa drifting to Palm Tree years ago had been the first South Sea island craft that the boy had seen. The fascination of it had remained with him. This canoe was bigger, broader of beam and the long skate-shaped piece of wood that formed the outrigger was connected with it not by outrigger poles but by a bridge.\n\nDick, as he steered, took in every little detail, the rattans of the grating, the way the mast stays were fixed to the grating and how the mast itself was stepped, the outrigger and the curve of its ends, the mat sail and the way it was fastened to the yard.\n\nThough he had never steered a canoe before, the sea-craft inborn in him carried him through, and the women crouching and watching and noting every detail saw nothing indicative of indecision.\n\nNow there are two ways in which one may upset a canoe of this sort by bad handling, one is to let the outrigger leave the water and tilt too high in the air, the other is to let the outrigger dip too deep in the water.\n\nDick seemed to know, and as they crossed the big lift of sea coming in with the flood from the break, he avoided both dangers.\n\nThe beach where the remnants of the southern tribe lived, was exactly opposite to the beach of the northern tribe, and as both beaches were close to the break in the reef, the distance from one to the other was little over a mile. Then as they drew close, Dick could see more distinctly the few remaining huts under the shelter of a grove of Jack-fruit trees; beyond the Jack-fruit stood pandanus palms bending lagoonward, and three tall coconut palms sharp against the white up-flaring horizon.\n\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the rebels. They were seated on the sand close to the most easterly of the huts, seated in the shadow of the Jack-fruit leaves; three old men seated, two with their knees up and one tailor fashion, whilst close to them by the edge of a little pool lay a girl.\n\nAs Dick drew near followed by the taller of the boat women, the girl, who had been gazing into the waters of the pool, looked up.\n\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the witch woman of Karolin now dead and gone to meet judgment for the destruction she had caused. Le Moan was only fourteen. She had heard of the coming of the new ruler to Karolin and of his bringing with him Katafa, the girl long thought to be dead. She had heard the order given to her grandfather Aioma that morning to come at once to the northern beach as the new chief required canoes to be built, and she had heard the old man\u2019s refusal. Le Moan had wondered what this new chief might be like. The monstrous great figure of Uta Matu, last king of Karolin, had come up in memory at the word \u201cchief,\u201d and now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women cried out \u201cHe comes,\u201d she saw Dick.\n\nDick with the sun on his face and on his red-gold hair, Dick naked and honey-coloured, lithe as a panther and straight as a stabbing spear. Dick with his eyes fixed on the three old men of Karolin who had turned their heads to gaze on Dick.\n\nLe Moan drew in her breath, then she seemed to cease breathing as the vision approached, passed her without a word and stood facing Aioma, the eldest and the greatest of the canoe-builders.\n\nLe Moan was only fourteen, yet she was tall almost as Katafa, she was not a true Polynesian; though her mother had been a native of Karolin, her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed years ago by Uta Matu, had given the girl European characteristics so strong that she stood apart from the other islanders as a pine might stand amongst palm trees.\n\nShe was beautiful, with a dark beauty just beginning to unfold from the bud and she was strange as the sea depths themselves. Sometimes seated alone beneath the towering Jack-fruits her head would poise as though she were listening, as though some voice were calling through the sound of the surf on the reef, some voice whose words she could not quite catch; and sometimes she would sit above the reef pools gazing deep down into the water, the crystal water where coralline growths bloomed and fish swam, but where she seemed to see more things than fish.\n\nThe sharp mixture of two utterly alien races some times produces strange results\u2014it was almost at times as if Le Moan were confused by voices or visions from lands of ancestry worlds apart.\n\nShe would go with Aioma fishing, and with her on board, Aioma never dreaded losing sight of land, for Le Moan was a pathfinder.\n\nBlindfold her on the coral and she would yet find her way on foot, take her beyond the sea-line and she would return like a homing pigeon. Like the pigeon she had the compass in her brain.\n\nThis was the only gift she had received from her mother, La Jennabon, who had received it from seafaring ancestors of the remote past.\n\nCrouching by the well she saw now Dick standing before Aioma and she heard his voice.\n\n\u201cYou are Aioma?\u201d said Dick, who had singled the chief of the three out by instinct.\n\nThe three old men rose to their feet. The sight of the newcomer helped, but it was the singling out of Aioma with such success by one who had never seen him that produced the effect. Surely here was a chief.\n\n\u201cI am Aioma,\u201d replied the other. \u201cWhat want you with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat which the woman had already told you,\u201d replied Dick, who hated waste of words or repeating himself.\n\n\u201cThey told me of the new chief who had come to the northern beach\u2014e uma kaio tau, and of how he had ordered canoes to be built,\u201d said Aioma, \u201cand I said, \u2018I am too old, and Uta is dead, and I know no chief but Uta; also in the last war on that Island in the north all the men of Karolin fell and they have never returned, they nor their canoes.\u2019 So what is the use of building more canoes when there are no men to fill them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe men are growing,\u201d said Dick.\n\n\u201cAy, they are growing,\u201d grumbled Aioma, \u201cbut it will be many moons before they are ready to take the paddle and the spear\u2014and even so, where is the enemy? The sea is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cAioma,\u201d said Dick, \u201cI have come from there,\u201d pointing to the north; \u201cthe sea is not clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have come from Marua (Palm Tree)?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come from Marua, where one day Katafa came, drifted from here in her canoe; there we lived till a little while ago when men landed, killing and breaking and burning\u2014burning even the big canoe they had come in. Then Katafa and I set sail for Karolin, for Karolin called me to rule her people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the men who landed to kill and burn?\u201d asked Aioma.\n\n\u201cThey are still on Marua; they have no canoes but they will build them, and surely they will come.\u201d\n\nNeither of Aioma\u2019s companions said a word whilst Aioma stood looking at the ground as if consulting it, then his eyes rose to Dick\u2019s face. Age and war had made Aioma wise, he knew men and he knew Truth when he saw her.\n\n\u201cI will do your bidding, Taori,\u201d said he quite simply, then he turned to the others, spoke some words to them, giving directions what to do till his return, and led the way to the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, still crouching by the well, said nothing. Her eyes were fixed on Dick, this creature so new, so different from any one she had ever seen. Perhaps the race spirit was telling her that here was a being of her father's race miraculously come to Karolin, perhaps she was held simply by the grace and youth of the newcomer\u2014who knows?\n\nDick, as he turned, noticed her fully for the first time and as their eyes met, he paused, held by her gaze and the strangeness of her appearance, so different from that of the other natives. For a moment his mind seemed trapped, then as his eyes fell he passed on and taking the steering paddle pushed off, the wind from the reef-break filling the sail of the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, rising and shading her eyes, stood watching as the sail grew less across the sparkling water, watching as the canoe rose and fell on the swell setting in from the break, watching as it reached the far white line of the northern beach where Katafa was waiting for the return of her lover.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE LITTLE SHIPS\n\nT\nHE primitive canoe of the Pacific is a dugout\u2014the trunk of a tree hollowed and shaped into the form of a boat, so narrow in proportion to its length as to be absolutely unstable but for the outrigger.\n\nThe outrigger, a long skate-shaped piece of wood fixed to port\u2014always to port\u2014by poles on a central bridge, is an apology to the sea for want of beam, and the sea accepts it\u2014on conditions. But for the outrigger, no canoe of any size would dare the sea, but for it the islands would have been sealed as between themselves, war made impossible, and the drift of people between island and island and between island and continent.\n\nFar away in the remote past some man once stood, the father of this daring invention; little dreaming of the vast consequences of the work to which he had put his hand.\n\nDick at the steering paddle saw a figure on the northern beach as they drew near. It was Katafa, waiting for him, the wind blowing her girdle of drac\u00e6na leaves and her hand sheltering her eyes against the sun. Standing just as Le Moan was standing on the southern beach sheltering her eyes and watching the canoe that carried the first man who had ever made her turn her head.\n\nSome children were playing near Katafa and a fishing canoe was putting out near by, but he saw only Katafa.\n\n\u201cKatafa,\u201d said Aioma, who was crouched by the after outrigger pole. \u201cIt is she sure enough, and they said she was dead and that her ghost had returned bringing you with her, Taori, but the dead do not return. Katafa, she was the girl under the taboo of Taminan, the girl no man or woman might touch, and then one day she went fishing beyond the reef and a storm took her and she was drowned, so they said.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was not drowned,\u201d replied Dick. \u201cThe wind blew her to Marua where I was\u2014I and another whose face I have near forgotten, Kearney, he was called, and he made canoes but not like these, then one day he went among the trees and did not return. Then the god Nan came to the island and after him the men of Karolin who fought together so that all were killed, and then came the bad men as I have told you and would have killed us but we left Marua in the night.... Look, there is the canoe we came in.\u201d He pointed to the dinghy hauled up on the beach.\n\n\u201cO he! Taori!\u201d It was Katafa\u2019s voice hailing them from the shore, glad, sweet, clear as a bell, yet far-carrying as the voice of a gull.\n\nAs Dick sprang out on the sands he seized her in his arms; parted only a few hours, it seemed to them that they had been weeks apart.\n\nIn the old days, even before he was born, his mother Emmeline had never been at ease when separated from his father even by the breadth of the lagoon, the demon that hints of mischance seemed always at her ear.\n\nDick seemed to have inherited with his power of love for Katafa, something of the dread of mischance for the beloved.\n\nHe embraced her, heedless of onlookers, though the only eyes to see were the eyes of the children and of Aioma who had eyes for nothing but the dinghy.\n\nAs soon as his foot touched sand, the canoe-builder made for it running like a boy, clapped his hand on the gunnel and then ran it over the planking.\n\nThe boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and had been destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ashore on the southern beach. The dinghy was carvel-built and entire, a perfect specimen of eastern boat-building over which the canoe designer brooded forgetful of Dick and Katafa, the beach he stood on and the sun that lit it.\n\nThe idea of a boat built of planking and not hollowed out of a tree trunk had been presented to him by the charred and shattered fragments of the Spanish boats, but how to get planking and how to bend it to the form he desired was beyond his imagination and beyond his means. He saw vaguely that these boats of the papalagi were made somewhat after the fashion of a man, with a backbone and ribs and a covering for the ribs, he saw that by this means enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger\u2014but then speed, where was there sign of speed in this thing squat and ugly?\n\nIn the early ages of the world in which Aioma still dwelt, ugliness had only two expressions, the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength.\n\nDick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost to be mistaken for a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far sight of the eyes and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy Aioma saw want of speed\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout which has neither keel nor ribs.\n\nThen Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision.\n\n\u201cWhich end is which of this pig fish?\u201d inquired Aioma of heaven and Dick, \u201cand he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\u201d\n\nDick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting at the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu which he and Katafa had made their own. There in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salved from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys\u2014fetiches from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where like a ghost in the sun dazzle moved a memory that was once a man\u2014Kearney.\n\nHe took the schooner from its rest and coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made.\n\nThe pool thirty feet long by twenty broad was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, it was clear as crystal, coral floored\u2014and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles, passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick on his knees launched the schooner and Aioma standing bent with a hand on each knee watched her as she floated on an even keel. Then on the merry west wind with helm properly set and main boom guyed out she went sailing down the pool to the east where Katafa had run to receive her.\n\nAioma watched, then Dick running to the other end showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore and how to set the head sails,\u2014had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model, and Aioma watched vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, whilst the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific.\n\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]"
